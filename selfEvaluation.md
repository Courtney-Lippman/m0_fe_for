# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I am about a 3 out for 4 in feeling confident about `for` statements.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I had both productive struggle and unproductive struggle. My struggle became unproductive when it was late at night and I was really tired.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I need to continue to practice for statements so that I am comfortable with them. I'll add some time tomorrow to practice more for statements.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I do not have any questions at the moment.
